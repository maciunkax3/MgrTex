\section*{Abstract}
Today's smartphones have more and more features that so far were only assigned to personal computers. These devices are built of better and more efficient components. Everything indicates that modern phones will replace ordinary computers. High computing power is required for tasks such as image processing, speech recognition and object detection. This paper analyzes the performance of the OpenCL environment on mobile devices, which is a library dedicated to high-speed parallel computing. This document examines how smartphones can access library that, as it turned out, is not officially supported on the Android platform, and briefly describes the analyzed library. As a part of the study, this api was tested in the context of the achieved computing power, memory flow rate, speed of matrix multiplication and the possibility of processing the image from the camera in real time. The obtained results were presented in graph format, described and analyzed. Applications that use this api for teaching deep neural networks or image processing were also discussed.
